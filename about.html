                <h4>1. Know Your Main Water Valve</h4>
                <p>Locate the main water shut-off valve for your home (usually outside or in the basement). Knowing its location and how to turn it off is critical in a burst pipe emergency to minimize water damage.</p>

                <h4>2. Never Put Grease Down the Sink</h4>
                <p>Pouring fats, oils, or grease down the kitchen sink is the number one cause of blocked drains. Always wipe greasy pots and pans with a paper towel before washing them.</p>

            <article class="tip-card">
                <h4>3. Be Mindful of Toilet Use</h4>
                <p>Only flush toilet paper. Items like wet wipes (even "flushable" ones), feminine hygiene products, or paper towels should always be placed in a bin to prevent clogs.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="tip-card">
                <h4>4. Insulate Exposed Pipes</h4>
                <p>During cold weather, ensure any exposed pipes, especially those outside or in unheated areas, are properly insulated. This prevents freezing, which is the cause of most winter burst pipes.</p>
