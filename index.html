        <h2>Brief History on Us</h2>
        <p>
          JHB NORTH PLUMBING was established nearly 30 years ago with the goal
          of delivering reliable, high-quality plumbing solutions to homes and
          businesses in Johannesburg and surrounding areas. From small
          residential repairs to large-scale commercial and industrial projects,
          the company has steadily built a reputation for professionalism,
          efficiency, and attention to detail. Over the years, JHB North
          Plumbing has successfully completed major developments in estates such
          as Featherbrooke, Douglasdale, Eagle Canyon, Waterfall Country Estate,
          Silver Valley Estate, and Pretoria. The company is also proud to have
          handled all plumbing installations at The Palm Continental Hotel in
          Johannesburg. Through consistent service excellence, JHB North
          Plumbing has grown from a small local business into a trusted name in
          the plumbing industry, recognized for its personalized service,
          cost-effective solutions, and commitment to customer satisfaction.
