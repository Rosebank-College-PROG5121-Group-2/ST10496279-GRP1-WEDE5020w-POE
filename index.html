      <h1>JHB NORTH PLUMBING</h1>
      <h2>Brief history on us:</h2>
      <p>
        JHB NORTH PLUMBING was established nearly 30 years ago with the goal of
        delivering reliable, high-quality plumbing solutions to homes and
        businesses in Johannesburg and surrounding areas. From small residential
        repairs to large-scale commercial and industrial projects, the company
        has steadily built a reputation for professionalism, efficiency, and
        attention to detail. Over the years, JHB North Plumbing has successfully
        completed major developments in estates such as Featherbrooke,
        Douglasdale, Eagle Canyon, Waterfall Country Estate, Silver Valley
        Estate, and Pretoria. The company is also proud to have handled all
        plumbing installations at The Palm Continental Hotel in Johannesburg.
        Through consistent service excellence, JHB North Plumbing has grown from
        a small local business into a trusted name in the plumbing industry,
        recognized for its personalized service, cost-effective solutions, and
        commitment to customer satisfaction.
